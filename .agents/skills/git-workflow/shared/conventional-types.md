# Conventional Types

Valid `<type>` values:

| `build` | Changes to the build system or external dependencies | — |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks not modifying src or test files | — |
| `ci` | Changes to CI/CD configuration or scripts | — |
| `docs` | Documentation changes only | — |
| `perf` | A code change that improves performance | — |

## Breaking changes

A breaking change correlates with MAJOR in SemVer. Mark it in one of two ways:

**Append `!` after the type/scope:**

```
feat(api)!: remove deprecated endpoint
```

**Or include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer:**

```
feat(api): remove deprecated endpoint

BREAKING CHANGE: The /v1/users endpoint has been removed. Use /v2/users instead.
```

Both forms may be combined.
